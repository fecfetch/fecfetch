# Polarization in Communication Channel Models

This project is a university presentation from Kiel University that explores the impact of antenna polarization in communication channel models. The primary focus is on comparing the performance of Spatial Channel Models (SCM) with both cross-polarized and single-polarized antenna arrays.

## Project Overview

The presentation covers the following key areas:

-   **Introduction to Communication Channels:** Basic concepts of communication channels and channel modeling.
-   **Communication Channel Models:** An overview of major models, including SCM, SCM-E, and WINNER.
-   **Polarization:** A discussion on what polarization is, its importance in wireless communications, and its applications.
-   **Software Implementation:** Details of the simulation setup in MATLAB to model and compare the effects of different polarization schemes. This includes:
    -   Antenna and environment setup.
    -   Configuration of power delay profiles, Angle of Departure (AoD), and Angle of Arrival (AoA).
    -   Calculation of channel matrices and channel capacity for both single-polarized and cross-polarized setups.
-   **Results:** Presentation of simulation results that demonstrate the differences in channel capacity under various conditions.
-   **Conclusion:** A summary of the findings and their implications.

## Technologies Used

-   **MATLAB:** For the simulation of the communication channel models.
-   **LaTeX (with Beamer):** For creating the presentation slides.
